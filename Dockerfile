# Lives at the repo root, not next to the app it builds. Railway's builder looks
# for a Dockerfile at the root of the build context and falls back to language
# autodetection when it finds none — which is how a Dockerfile one directory down
# gets silently ignored and the deploy fails claiming it cannot tell what the app
# is. Keeping it here means the service needs no Root Directory setting to work.

# Debian's headless Chromium came back on 2026-10-28 for one job: the dive-deeper
# editor's proof screenshots of a client's own pages (src/divedeeper/shots.ts, via
# puppeteer-core). One browser per report, closed after its few shots.
