// G / fixed — how AI sees you, with a FIXED question set.
// Eleven questions from one template, filled with the dive's name, trade and area, so the
// same set can be asked of every company, every month. Asked of every model in
// G-shared ANSWER_MODELS (deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017 and gpt-6.1-sol), then a judge call
// scores each answer against the dive's facts.
//
// Round 3: every question is asked DD_G_REPEAT times (default 3) per model; findings report the
// majority answer and the spread. A DNS check runs on every domain the answers give for the company.
// Calls: 1 (profile) + 11 x 2 x 3 answers + 11 x 2 x 3 judge = 133 LLM calls. No Exa.
// Env: DD_G_TEMP (answer temperature, default 0), DD_G_MAX (only the first N questions),
//      DD_G_REPEAT, DD_G_BRIEF=0 (no brevity request), DD_G_MODELS, DD_G_JUDGE.
// Limit: the models on our keys have no web access; answers reflect training data only.
