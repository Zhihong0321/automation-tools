// Does this mini actually read pages? Run it on the mini, against the live
// Crawl4AI container, before trusting the worker with a dive:
//
//   node agy-lab/local-fetch-worker/check.ts
//   node agy-lab/local-fetch-worker/check.ts https://some-site.example/ ...
//
// It uses the worker's own readPage, so a pass here means the worker's half of
// the job works: the container is up, the token in worker.env is the one it
// wants, and a page comes back as text. It never touches the hub.
//
// The default list is deliberately mixed: two real company sites, one host with
// no DNS record (which must come back as a clean error, not a crash) and one
// page that is mostly chrome (which is where the fit→raw fallback earns itself).
